            Research at COMPOSE covers both theoretical and empirical problems
            on socio-economic and political developments of Muslim states and
            societies and their inter-connections with world society. COMPOSE
            tries to offer a distinctive approach to the empirical study of
            Muslim states and societies by combining a rich understanding of the
            historical development of these states and societies and advanced
            knowledge and skills on research methodology in social sciences. The
            research utilizes qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method
            approaches in social sciences.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            COMPOSE acknowledges that mutual understanding between Muslim states
            or societies and other parts of the world is necessary for the
            creation of a peaceful and prosperous world society. For this
            purpose, COMPOSE promotes sincere and constructive dialogues between
            communities of scholars through research, publication and public
            outreach.
