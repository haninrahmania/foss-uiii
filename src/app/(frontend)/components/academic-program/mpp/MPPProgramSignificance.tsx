          While the younger generation in the North is worried about their future due to climate change,
          the youth in the South are simultaneously grappling with the daily realities of the climate crisis.
          <br /><br />
          Privileged lifestyles in the Global North—such as those in Europe, North America, and East Asia—
          produce a carbon footprint 100 times greater than that of the world’s poorest nations combined.
          This stark inequality demands urgent attention.
          <br /><br />
          Uncovering these global inequalities, identifying effective countermeasures, and crafting public
          policies that reflect the realities of the Global South are essential steps in addressing the
          climate crisis. Programs that focus on climate policy from a Southern perspective hold the
          potential to reshape global sustainability discourse and empower a new generation of policy leaders.
