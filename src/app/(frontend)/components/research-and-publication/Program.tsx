            Research Approaches
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Research at COMPOSE uses quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-method
            approaches. Quantitative approach is used to explain general
            patterns and establish causal impacts in the pattern, while
            qualitative approach is employed to elucidate its causal mechanism.
            Mixed-method approaches are used to combine the strength of both
            qualitative and quantitative approaches to political explanation.
            Research at COMPOSE also utilises rigorous and updated research
            methodologies in social science in accordance with international
            standards.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            As part of its mission, COMPOSE promotes constructive and sincere
            dialogues between different communities of scholars and faith
            through public discussion, seminars, workshops and conferences. The
            Center will also engage with policy makers to promote its research
            findings in order to improve public policies.
